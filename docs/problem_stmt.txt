Summary: Government purchases various components through tender which takes a lot of time as the process of allocation of tender takes more than 2 months. Often it is observed after allocation of tender the fulfillment of the required tender takes more than required time. From tender allocation to tender completion it takes more than 6 months to complete all the process as government itself have to compare all the required items. Addressing this issue will help the government in having transparency and parity in rates of items procured by different Govt organizations and the entire process of tender allocation will take very less time then what is taking now.
